To assign the labels (Pass/Fail), I used a custom multiplication rule: if the product of Study Hours and Attendance is greater than 250, the student is labeled as Pass (1); otherwise, they are labeled as Fail (0). This rule ensures that a student needs a balance of both effort and presence to succeed, which creates a clear pattern for the Perceptron to learn\n",
